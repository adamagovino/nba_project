    "Determining the quality of a basketball team's makeup has been the focus of sports data analysis for several years. Advanced stats, measuring all facets of a player's game, from win shares, PIPM, PER, etc each have made their mark in the analytics space.  However, examining the process of constructing a team is something that certainly warrants further analysis and comprehension.  Specifically, the degree to which contract dollars and player performance are correlated appears to be an area that, analytically, is untapped (at least publically).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability of an NBA general manager (GM) to proficiently perform their job has long been defined, perhaps too simplistically, by wins and losses on the court.  However, I believe that the minutiae of the individual transactions that a GM performs is more indicative of their overall basketball acumen vs the wins and losses that I believe are more indicative of coaching.  As fans, we love to dissect the moves that a GM makes.  How many times have you read about a transaction that your favorite team just made, or saw a Woj bomb and thought “Man, if only I ran the team!” Maybe you’ve had the feeling that a talented team fell on some bad luck or that a particular team was full of overpaid players. Maybe you’ve thought that a botched trade doomed a team for years or that posturing for cap space is an ulimately flawed endeavour. How a GM pays for talent is behind every team’s success or lack thereof.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than simply say \"Masai Ujiri was the best GM of the 2018-19 season because the Toronto Raptors won the NBA title\" - I am looking to analyze and grade the transactions that Ujiri has made each season that led his team to the title.  I'd like to put a quantitative value on particular transactions rather than say \"It was a good trade\" or \"He should have never signed that guy.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "I sought out to find a way to analyze, rate, and compare GMs over the years based on a number of factors.  The primary ways in which a GM can affect their team's wins and losses are via free agent signings, the draft, trades, and releasing players.  With each of these transactions, the common theme is that the particular success or or failure of said transaction is tied to the player's performance, the capital needed to acquire that player, and the degree to which the transaction allows the franchise to remain financially flexible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To grade a player and/or his contract, I decided to take a look at two main data points: 1) each team’s yearly cash expenditure on every player they employed, and 2) the stats that those players accumulated while receiving that cash. I believe that this derived ‘net value’ lays the groundwork to answer several potential followup questions, which I'll theorize at the conclusion of this post - the first in a series dedicated to the guys who build, modify, bring greatness to, and ultimately doom our favorite teams."

    "### Methodology"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Each player contract and/or season is calculated to have an \"contract adjusted value\" (CAV) and a \"net value\" (NET).  CAV estimates what a player's contract \"should be\" considering their advanced stats.  NET is the difference between a player's actual contract and their CAV value.  NET scales the dollar amount of a contract to the average dollar amount of a contract for a player performing at a similar level according to whatever \"all-in-one\" advanced analytic statistical value is chosen.  This is meant to differentiate a player that has a VORP of 4.9 making $10,000,000/yr vs another with the same VORP making only $2,500,000/yr.  The 'average' NET would be zero; that is to say, an average NBA player would have a NET of zero because he is playing at exactly his contract's worth.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of grading historic seasons, the player's actual values are used. For future seasons, the player's predicted stats are used, calculated using k-nearest neighbors and machine learning.  This matches a player to other similar historical players, by previous stats at the same ages, and then looks at the trajectory of their stats going forward in order to \"predict\" our player's stats. \n",
    "\n",
    "I looked for a table that had player’s advanced stats, draft position, and contract info all in once place. This proved impossible (surprisingly, given the data world’s passion for all things roundball-related), so I decided to make gather and wrangle my own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I scraped data from both basketball reference and spotrac. These both involved quite amount of cleaning (BR had inconsistent salaries and spotrac had inconsistent player cash take-homes prior to 2015-16, just to name a few issues). Traded players also required cash adjustments. A minor note: player performance (and thus GM performance) was compared to a player’s cash take home (what a GM spent on a player) and not necessarily their cap hit, which is the traditional measure of a team’s spend. A player traded mid season would not have a cap hit for their initial team, but obviously they accumulate stats and receive a salary - which for purposes of this analysis, should be the basis of their value. Also noted in the scrape was any outcome/note for a particular contract - this included ten-day, waived, two-way, and amnestied contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining 'how a player performs' is a bit more subjective.  Traditional box score stats generally don't translate well across different teams/situations (eg - points per game doesn't mean much if a player's usage rate is unusually high on a team that isn't winning much, or if they simply just shoot the ball a lot).  They also don't give a complete scope of how a player is performing - a player may be scoring a lot, but how is he on defense?  \n",
    "\n",
    "All-in-one/advanced stats (PER, WS, BPM/VORP, TS%, etc) have been in the lexicon now for years, but there is no consensus on which one to use.  They can be dependent on a number of variables - teammates, roles, coaching, offensive style, rotations, roster makeup.  I was looking for a stat which best represented the portability of a player's talent - ie what stat would best represent a player's abilities if he went to another team? \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to do some research; Ben Taylor at Nylon Calculus had a great write-up on advanced stats (https://fansided.com/2019/01/08/nylon-calculus-best-advanced-stat/).  This article really dives into the weeds - while there is no definitive conclusion, it makes a good case for a few stats, including box plus/minus (BPM), which can be scraped from basketball reference.  The only drawback is that BPM is a rate statistic and will exclude a large portion of players, making it impossible to rate entire teams.  I would need something that allows for every player to be rated.  VORP - which is based on BPM, but adjusts for minutes played - would work well for this.  Basketball reference has this statistic, so I decided to go with VORP for this project. "

Aside from the max contract perennial superstars whose value is known (Lebron James, James Harden, Kahwi Leonard), NET highlights players who we \"know\" are good (yet their salaries do not reflect it yet) who are giving an amazing return on their salary.  On a rookie deal, Luka Doncic has the most valuable NET in the league. Other players on rookie deals - Domantas Sabonis, Trae Young, Mitchell Robinson, and Bam Adebayo are among the top 20 NET players in the league! In addition, NET finds value in players who are neither on a rookie deal nor yet max players (Fred VanVleet, Montrezl Harrell).  \n",

    "Now that the basis for player value, CAV, has been defined, there are several possible avenues to go for further analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Grading all transactions based on CAV\n",
    "\n",
    "With each transaction, there is a net CAV added to each team/GM.  As such, it is possible to grade each transaction and then use that grade in further grouping of transactions.  Within a particular GM (or team, player, division, conference etc), a user would have the ability to group transactions by time period, player position, or transaction type (trade, signing, draft, etc) and also graph/compare their selection to a comparable selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow quantitative answers to questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - \"What was the most lopsided trade of the past 10 years?\"\n",
    "  - \"Who are the top 10 contracts in the NBA?\"\n",
    "  - \"Was Phil Jackson a good drafting GM despite his horrible W-L record as Knicks GM?\"\n",
    "  - \"How is the Kristaps Porzingus trade graded now vs when it was made?\"\n",
    "  - \"What was the worst free agent signing during the last offseason?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Grading drafted players and assigning value to future draft picks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no way to assign future draft picks a CAV based on statistics, a compilation of historical stats based on draft position can be undertaken.  From these stats, a four year total CAV can be calculated for each draft position, based on the standard first round rookie contracts from the current CBA.  Using this, future draft picks now have a quantitative value which can be used in evaluation of trades involving draft picks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the exact draft position of a future pick is almost always unknown (unless it is traded between the window of the draft lottery and the draft), this model uses a range to determine where a draft pick might fall.  For example, in 2019-20, the Lakers trading their first round pick during the season would be projected to be in the bottom 20% of the first round, between picks 24-30.  Therefore the CAV for that pick would be the average of the historical CAVs for picks 24-30.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Grading cap flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "There is perhaps no quicker fix-all for a GM and a team than free agent signings.  As such, successfully creating, keeping, and maneuvering among cap space remains possibly a GM’s most important attribute other than talent evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can take the average value gained per dollar spent through free agent signings during historical offseasons and scale that value to cap space created or lost during a transaction.  The longest possible contract that can be given in the NBA is five seasons, so this portion of the model could add or take away from a team’s total possible cap space over this time period. "
